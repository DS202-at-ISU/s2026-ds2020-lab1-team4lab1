# Lab report \#1

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.

\##step 12.3

- Wyatt’s note: This was very straight forward as I have used git
  multiple times.

- Jensen: This is a line from Rstudio

\##step 12.4

- Wyatt’s note: This part is the same logic as using a git terminal. I
  just dont have to type the commands, just have to get used to pushing
  the buttons.
